# EWAVR Simulation example

This is a bare bones example to simulator in EWAVR using semihosting (stdout to console). It is a completely default project with only two changes:

- Set processor to ATMega128
- Set output to debug with semihosting enabled

I ran the simulator in the IDE once which generates the batch/PowerShell scripts in the `settings` subfolder
